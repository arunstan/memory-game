Simple game to test your memory! Click a tile to reveal the shape behind it, and click another to see the one behind that. If they match, they stay revealed and if they do not match, both close and click another tile to try again. Use your previous knowledge from memory to reveal all the tiles in least number of moves and time. Click restart to re-shuffle and restart the game anytime.
